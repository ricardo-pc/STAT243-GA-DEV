## Diabetes example

print("Performance on diabetes dataset. This set of best covariates is based on an exhaustive all subsets search using AIC as the fitness score (rather than CV-based prediction error), with the R^2 simply the in-sample R^2 (and therefore likely a bit too high) based on that set of predictors. Your predictor set might differ a bit and your CV R^2 might be a bit lower. For this task, if your time reaches into the 10s or 100s of seconds, that would be concerning.\n")
